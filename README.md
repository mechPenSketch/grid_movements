# Grid Movement

## Getting Started

### Requirement
Godot Engine v3.x

### Installation
After downloading, open Godot Engine Project Manager. Click Import, go to the folder you've downloaded, and select "project.godot".

## Usage
The scene contains a player (green) and an obstacle (orange). The player can move in any direction, using arrow keys. The obstacle blocks the player's way.

## Potential Updates
Following this release, there are more things I want to add onto this asset, including:
### Minor Additions
* Using tool mode to bind TileMap's cell size into Grid Step for snapping.
